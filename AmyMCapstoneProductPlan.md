Capstone Product Plan

# Personal Learning Goals: 
- Learning Java
- Building a mobile app

# Problem Statement: 

Dating apps currently allow users to cast a wide net rather than exhibit selectivity, and unlimited text messaging as the main form of communication prolongs often dead-end interactions where compatibility could be more quickly determined via phone call. Haunt limits user selection per day, displays (essential!) information about their potential match's birth chart, and sums up compatitiblity in a single emoji. If matched, users can select a time to talk on the phone, and the app then connects them anonymously.

# Market Research:

## Competition:
- Tinder: 
- Hinge: 
- Bumble: 
- OkCupid: 
- The League: 
- IRL bars: 

research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem.
differentiation: what makes your idea/product different

# User Personas: 
Peyton: A gender fluid Gen Z 21 year old, disillusioned with disconnection, who finds talking on the phone to feel fresh but also vintage. Tarot is their side-hustle, and they take their birth chart very seriously. 

Rohini: An elder millenial femme, not afraid of talking on the phone, and in fact considers it nostalgic! Finds the idea of eliminating unsolicited in-app messaging a refreshing way to cut through the bullshit. Recently figured out their zodiac sign and now consider astrology memes more insightful than therapy.

Jared: A Gen X divorc√© more than willing to revert to familiar phone call territory, as they never quite mastered the witticism required for text messaging. Finds astrology insufferable, but will give it a whirl.
