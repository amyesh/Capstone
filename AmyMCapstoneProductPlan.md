Capstone Product Plan
The second deliverable for the capstone is your product plan.

Product Plan Components
Personal Learning Goals: A list outlining the major things that you want to focus on learning in this project.

Problem Statement: A clear, concise statement describing the problem your project will solve. Re-use the problem statement from the concept write-up or update if you've made adjustments.

Market Research: Outline the key insights from your research, including:

your applicationâ€™s competition - what alternatives are already out there (competing apps and/or non-app solutions)
research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem.
differentiation: what makes your idea/product different
User Personas: A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics? How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?

Trello Board:

Flesh out the feature set that you created in the conceptual delivery to get started with your Trello board
Technology selections:

Front-end
Back-end
Infrastructure - Deployment or Code
Wireframes:

Any format you may like - photos of paper, online tool and/or paper to show your instructors
Format
Since the Product Plan is part of your final deliverable and should be included in your repository, it would be easiest to do this initial draft in a markdown format for easy transferability to GitHub.
